"""
@title Healthcare Dashboard
@dev This Python application creates a user interface for a healthcare form using Streamlit.
The form allows users to input their name, age, and upload a file (e.g., medical record). 
It sends the data to a backend API for processing.

@notice The application validates user inputs before submission and handles backend responses,
providing feedback to the user based on the API response.

@backend This application interacts with a Flask backend API endpoint located at `http://localhost:5000/api/form`.
